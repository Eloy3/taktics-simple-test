# taktics-simple-test

This project is the solution to a test described in: https://gitlab.com/jplaza4/taktics-simple-test/-/blob/main/README.md

The solution is provided using xampp, as that is the technology I'm used to from university projects. So in order to visualize the program, one must install the app: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

Once Xampp is installed:

- Open the Xampp controll panel and start the Apache and MySQL modules.
- Find the folder where xampp is installed and navigate to \htdocs. Inside the folder, copy the 'taktics' folder provided in this repository.
- Back in the control panel click on the 'admin' button for MySQL. That will open a website where you must create a database with the name 'taktics'. You can start with an empty database but I recommend importing the tables provided in the repository file 'taktics.sql'.
- Navigate to http://localhost/taktics/login.html to view the solution.
- Try the user 'Eloy' with the password '123' or create another user clicking on 'register'.
